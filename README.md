## JPACRUDProject

### Overview

Welcome, to the project known as Car Query. Here all your dream vehicles can be uploaded into 
a compacted SQL Database for ease of access to the user.
The program runs of the common structural elements of a good OOP and using simple CRUD for user interface interaction.

### Topics
* SQL
* MySQL
* Relational Databases
* JDBC
* MAMP
* Object-Relational Mapping
* Encapsulation
* Spring Suite
* Advanced Request Handling
* Gradle
* Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
* Configuring a JPA project.
* Mapping Entities to SQL tables.
* Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
* Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
* Performing basic CRUD operations.
* Deploying an application to AWS


#### How it works

1. A user can enter a Car's preconfigured ID and see the details of the car in a web page.
2. A user can choose to add a new car. They can enter all the properties of the car. Their input will be used to create a Car object, which the DAO implementation will save in the database. If the insert fails, the user is informed of this.
3. When a user retrieves a car, they have the option of deleting it. If they delete the car, it is removed from the database. If the delete fails (such as, due to child records), the user is informed of this.
4. When a user retrieves a car, they have the option of editing it. If they choose this, all the car's current properties are displayed in a form, allowing them to change any property except the car's ID. When they submit the form, that car's record is updated in the database. If the update fails, the user is informed of this.

### Lessons Learned
1. With the knowledge that I have presently gained, not all contingencies can be addressed regarding HTML inputting user inputs.
3. The importance of becoming familiar with CSS/HTML and all of its abilities.
4. Experience was gained decoding exception and errors.
5. Coding is never done... There is always something to improve.
